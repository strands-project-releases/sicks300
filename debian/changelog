  * Bugfix to support custom input frames
  * Merge pull request #7 <https://github.com/strands-project/sicks300/issues/7> from larics/master
    Improvements to the readData function
  * Merge pull request #2 <https://github.com/strands-project/sicks300/issues/2> from ojura/master
    Rewrite of the serial communication
  * Change debug messages severity to ROS_DEBUG
  * Use read blocking, eliminate the main loop timer
    With cyclades-serial-client, the interface does not actually block until
    all requested bytes have been read, but the package is read in about 10
    iterations of the main loop, which is an acceptable amount of "busy waiting".
  * Add a connect hook
    This system command is executed before the laser connection is opened (also
    on reconnection). It is specified using the optional ROS parameter
    ~connect_cmd (default: none).
  * Make ROS node handles node class member variables
    They shouldn't go out of scope when the node constructor is finished
  * Improve reconnection logic, add a warning for stale measurements
    Stale measurements can happen with a serial->ethernet converter, we detect
    this by querying the number of bytes in the RX buffer.
  * Perform a rewrite of the readData function
    - fix the occasional bad checksum issue, which was occuring due to a race
    condition caused by a bad check if enough bytes had been received
    - add a map of the laser data packet layout in the comments
    - removed ugly offset constants in favour of a more systematic approach
    to addressing elements of the data packet
    - introduce a sane way of calculating the total packet size and addressing
    the differences between the two protocol versions
    - previous also fixes discarding bytes of the processed packet in protocol
    version 1.03, when 10 bytes from the end of the packet weren't discarded;
    now the find header loop doesn't have to go through them
    - fix comment typo in sicks300.h
    - release memory claimed by m_ranges
  * Update .gitignore, minor cosmetic code tweaks
  * Minor reformat of code indentation
  * Add some debugging output
  * Convert error messages in serial communication to use ROS_ERROR
  * Add reading of additional scan metadata
    i.e. the scan number and the telegram number

  * Allow user to select reduced field of view.
    This commit replaces the bool 'reduced_fov' parameter with double 'field_of_view'. This allows the user to select what angle of view the laser should publish. Setting this to 180 will have the same effect as setting reduced_fov to 1 previously. Setting it to 260 will remove 5 degrees from the start and end of the scan.
