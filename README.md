sicks300
========

ROS package for reading continuous data output of the SICK S300 Professional laser scanner via RS-422. Note that it supports both the old (v.1.02) and the new (v.1.03) protocol.

Please note that this is an extension of the original "fuerte" driver that was developed by the Autonomous Intelligent Systems Department at Bonn University.

Getting started
===============

Make sure that all dependencies are satisfied:

    $ rosmake sicks300 sicks300

Run the node:

    $ rosrun sicks300 sick300_driver
